# Eye Drowsiness Alert System 👁️🚨

This project is a real-time eye drowsiness detection system built using computer vision.  
It monitors eye closure through a webcam and triggers an alarm if eyes remain closed for a continuous duration.

This system can be used for **driver drowsiness detection**, **student alert systems**, and **fatigue monitoring**.
